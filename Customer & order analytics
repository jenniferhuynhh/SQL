#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
AND length(orderID) = 6;

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
***** look at this again

SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
AND length(orderID) = 6;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT 
Product, 
price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
GROUP BY Product;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT 
Product,
SUM(Quantity)*price AS Total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
AND length(orderID) = 6
GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT 
Product,
SUM(Quantity),
SUM(Quantity*price) AS Total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT 
COUNT(distinct acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
